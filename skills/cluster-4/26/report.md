## Summary

Our team decided to first use levelDB and node from the example since there was an already written code from the breif. In doing so, we decided it was best to instead try out mongoDB in which we were successful in doing and inserting the document to mongoDB. We decided to use my account for the quest but for testing we use our own respective accounts.
