## Summary

So I collected the values from SCL and SDA over I2C. The LIDAR sends data over 2 bytes; both of the bytes are read. Then the distance is calculated. The distance is displayed on console. Since it uses I2C, I used the accelerometer code from previous quest as well as a code snippet on piazza. The wiring was done using the datasheet.
