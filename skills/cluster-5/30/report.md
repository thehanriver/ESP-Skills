## Summary

I read the design pattern brief and started off with ESP example code for servos. In doing so, I added the calibrate ESC method that was given to us as well as the code snippet from  PWM modulation. I believe 1400 was neutral and anyting above was speeding and below was reversing. I tried going max left and max right while also trying all different directions. I believe there was an older version of Callibrate ESC that my teammate said was better so I used that.
