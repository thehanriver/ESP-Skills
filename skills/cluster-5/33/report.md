## Summary

I used PID design pattern code on whizzer. I copied ultarsound code from a previous quest into my file and changed the output of my ultrasound to the measured value variable (called distance). I then looked at the error value and if it was below 0, I turn the Red LED on, if it was equal to 0, Green LED on and if it was more than 0 I turned the Blue LED on. I also set the set point to 50cm.
The timer initialization is taken from a previous skill.
