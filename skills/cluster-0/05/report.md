## Summary

Installed driver and espressif tool chain. Problem with installation because user folder had a white space and couldn't change paths. So I made another User folder and downloaded esp-if there. Don't know if it will work for more complex projects but it works for hello_world so I will try other examples. So far, everything is running smoothly with little or no errors.
