## Summary

Following the example code and the cvs file provided, I chose to do a multi-series line chart to display my data. I saved chart-csv.txt as chart.csv to make it a csv file. The example code helped get the values from csv and transfer them to localhost:8080. From there, I made it so that depending on the company (e.g. FB,GOOGL,etc.) it will seperate the date and closing to an array specifically made for each company. In doing so, I sorted the data coming in into 4 arrays. After, I rendered the charts on load (following canvasJs tutorial on how to render charts).
