## Summary

This skill took a lot of time to do especially because my other two teammates live close to each other and sharing the router ( They live on the other side of campus ). Initially, I tried using my iPhone hotspot as a router but ran into technical difficulties. I could only complete these skill when my I visited my teammates house since they had the router and trying to find a time they were home proved difficult.

Other than the vast problems I had figuring out ethernet gadget and connecting to wi-fi (the raspberry pi only wanted to connect SOMETIMES and three people attempted to try and fix mine which was certainly weird), I finally got it to connect and followed a tutorial installing git, node, and running a node server as shown below.
