## Summary

For console I/O i used the blink example and example code (from Github) to guide me. For coding itself,
I used the printf(),scanf(), and gets() method instead of the uart_read/uart_write method because it wouldn't
show proper outputs on my terminal. Also, I used flags (shown in the code) to switch between the three states.
