## Summary

For the servos skill, I copied the example code given to me in the brief. In doing so, I figured out what the colors mean and how to connect esp32 and the servo itself (Red: power,Brown: ground, Orange: pin). From this, I just tested out which min pulsewidth and max pulsewidth would make the servo go all the way (180 degrees).
