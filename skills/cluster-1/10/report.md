## Summary

  For the coding process, I looked at two of the previous skills to help me. I used my LED code from skill 7 and my alphanumeric display
  code from skill 8. However, trying to figure out what code to use was difficult since there was no place to start. However, realizing 
  that I can just get the GPIO level when its high as an input that led me to start on coding which was not too difficult.
