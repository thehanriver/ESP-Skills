## Summary

I reflashed my SD because even with the wpa_supplicant.conf file gone, it wouldn't work. I set up my pi as a ethernet gadget and shared my network with it following the tutorials.
I also download the XRDP package and used the remote desktop app to manually connect to "Group_2" wifi network which is ours. After a long time debugging, I managed to connect to it.

## Sketches and Photos

Enabled network sharing for internet:

Pinging from PuTTy to show it's connected:
