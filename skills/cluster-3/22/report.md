## Summary

I went to the esp-idf examples and found stations in the wifi folder. I build and flashed it before i went into menu config to set "SSID" to "mario's iPhone" and "password" to "Mari0ppai". It didn't connect with my hotspot but I'm pretty sure it will connect to the router. The only reason I couldn't was due to the fact that I couldn't meet up with my teammate since he was out and about and he haas the router.

## Sketches and Photos

Me running the code and not connecting to my hot spot:
