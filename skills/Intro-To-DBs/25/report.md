## Summary

For this skill , I used the traffic lights example as a base code. By changing some of the functions, I was able to essentially use the LEDS as confirmatino to sending. Since I needed another board and my teammates already built one, I used theirs to test. 
Communication is two way, if the button is pressed, it changes the LED to the next color and if the other button on the other board is pressed it does the same as well (demonstrated on the video).

I used one button for this mainly just to test but we ,as a team, put two buttons on all our boards and tested it so that one button changes the LED and the other sends the UDP package.

This will be shown in the video.
