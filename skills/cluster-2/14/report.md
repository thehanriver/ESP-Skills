## Summary

Used the code from skill 13 and replaced the calculation part to turn voltage into distance. Based on the Maxbotics tutorial, created a formula that will convert mV to cm. Looking at the quest brief, pretty simple to wire up using the 3.3V power source.

## Sketches and Photos

How the ultrasonic looks wired up:

Kind of hard to read values but 22cm(142mV) seems to be the minimum distance before getting readings:

Me measuring to see if it correctly measures data:
